- [ ] Check API usage in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Set up alerts for errors (optional)

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with deployed URL
- [ ] Document any custom configuration
- [ ] Share deployment URL with stakeholders

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check:

### Frontend Issues
- [ ] Check Vercel build logs
- [ ] Verify Next.js version compatibility
- [ ] Ensure all static assets are present
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

### Backend Issues
- [ ] Check backend logs
- [ ] Verify `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set
- [ ] Test backend URL directly
- [ ] Check Python dependencies are installed

### Integration Issues
- [ ] Verify backend URL in `vercel.json` is correct
- [ ] Check CORS configuration
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl/Postman
- [ ] Verify network tab in browser dev tools

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or has critical issues:

### Vercel
- [ ] Go to Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Select your project
- [ ] Go to Deployments
- [ ] Find previous working deployment
- [ ] Click "..." menu â†’ "Promote to Production"

### Backend
- [ ] Use platform's rollback feature
- [ ] Or redeploy previous version from git

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- âœ… Application loads without errors
- âœ… Logo displays correctly in header
- âœ… Users can upload images
- âœ… AI generates meme suggestions
- âœ… Users can customize and download memes
- âœ… Application works on desktop and mobile
- âœ… No console errors or warnings
- âœ… Response times are acceptable

## Notes

### API Costs
- Google Gemini: Free tier = 15 requests/minute
- Monitor usage at https://console.cloud.google.com

### Scaling Considerations
- Vercel: Free tier handles decent traffic
- Backend: Free tier has limitations (cold starts)
- Consider paid tiers for production traffic

### Security
- [ ] Environment variables are set securely
- [ ] No API keys in frontend code
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (automatic with Vercel)
