- [x] Provide Capacitor configuration template
- [x] Provide package.json template for Node.js dependencies
- [x] Provide AndroidManifest.xml template for permissions
- [x] Document backend hosting requirements and options
- [x] Document complete step-by-step build process

  - Initialize Capacitor project with templates
  - Configure Android permissions and app settings
  - Copy Reflex frontend build to Capacitor
  - Sync Capacitor with Android platform
  - Build APK using Android Studio

- [ ] Configure environment variables (GOOGLE_API_KEY) on hosting platform
- [ ] Update Capacitor config with production API URL
- [ ] Rebuild APK with production backend URL
- [ ] Install APK on Android device for testing
- [ ] Verify all functionality: camera, AI generation, download
- [ ] Test offline behavior and error handling
- [ ] Generate signed APK for distribution (optional)

## Important Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend Hosting Required**: The Reflex backend (Python server) must be hosted online because:
- APK is just the frontend wrapper
- AI generation happens on the backend (Gemini API calls)
- Backend needs GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable

üì± **What You Get**:
- Native Android APK file
- Native camera access
- "Installed app" experience
- Can be distributed outside Play Store

üîß **Next Steps**:
1. Read ANDROID_BUILD_GUIDE.md thoroughly
2. Install all prerequisites
3. Follow the step-by-step build process
4. Host backend before testing APK
